# IoT-Project
## Business Outline:

The Smart Home system is designed to provide increased comfort, control and energy efficiency with IoT technology. The system integrates a network of smart devices that communicate with a cloud backend to automate and optimize household tasks. Key features include real-time monitoring of home environments, remote control of appliances and energy usage tracking. With simple setup, users can manage their home anywhere via a mobile app or web dashboard, thereby improving their living experience by reducing utility costs.

The solution uses IoT sensors and actuators to collect data, which is processed and stored in the cloud. This allows for scalable data management and real-time insights.
A REST API handles the requests and logic ensuring seamless integration between devices, cloud and user interfaces.

## User Stories:
1. Remote Control of Devices:
As a homeowner, I want to remotely control my lights and thermostat so that I can manage energy consumption efficiently when Iâ€™m away.

2. Energy-Saving Automation:
As a homeowner, I want the system to automatically turn off unused devices, so that I can reduce energy waste and lower my bills.
