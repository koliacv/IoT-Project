# IoT-Project

## Business Outline

The Smart Home system is designed to provide increased comfort, control, and energy efficiency through IoT technology. The system integrates a network of smart devices that communicate with a cloud backend to automate and optimize household tasks. Key features include real-time monitoring of home environments, remote control of appliances, and energy usage tracking. With simple setup, users can manage their home anywhere via a mobile app or web dashboard, thereby improving their living experience by reducing utility costs.

The solution uses IoT sensors and actuators to collect data, which is processed and stored in the cloud. This allows for scalable data management and real-time insights. A REST API handles the requests and logic, ensuring seamless integration between devices, the cloud, and user interfaces.

## Main Components and Properties

### Real-time Monitoring and Analysis
IoT sensors and actuators placed throughout the home collect data on temperature, lighting, energy use, security status, etc. This data is continuously processed and stored in the cloud, where it is analyzed to provide real-time insights and historical usage trends. Users can access this information to monitor their home environment and make informed changes to their habits.

### Remote Control and Automation
The system allows users to control equipment, lights, and heaters remotely via a secure connection. This function helps homeowners save energy by turning off appliances when not in use and adjusting settings like lights or the thermostat before arriving home. Users can also set up automatic routines based on schedules or situations, such as dimming lights in the evening or turning on safety features when leaving the house.

### Energy Efficiency and Cost Savings
By tracking energy use and providing data-based recommendations, the system promotes energy-saving behavior. Features such as automatic device shutdown, energy use monitoring, and detailed analysis help users reduce unnecessary energy waste, thereby reducing monthly costs. Additionally, insights into peak usage times help users make energy-efficient choices, reducing environmental impact.

### Advanced Safety and Security Alerts
The Smart Home system has security sensors to detect movement, door or window openings, and other potentially suspicious activities. When unusual patterns are detected, such as unexpected movement in the house, users receive real-time notifications on their mobile devices. Safety features also include high-temperature warnings to enhance security.

## User Stories
